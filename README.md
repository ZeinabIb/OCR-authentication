# OCR Authentication
FastAPI-based application designed for processing images and extracting text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with the help of EasyOCR and OpenCV libraries. The application leverages FastAPI to create a web server that accepts image uploads, processes these images to detect and extract text, and returns the results in a structured JSON format.
